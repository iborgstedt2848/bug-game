PROJECT TITLE: Bug Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create an interactive bug game that allows users to input parameters for the size of the field (nxn), 
the number of maximum moves m, and the starting coordinate of the bug. The bug will randomly move m times around the board, 
placing an X over boxes that it hits. After m moves, the bug wins if it has marked every box with an X and the bug loses if 
any boxes are left unmarked. The game continues until the user "quits" and keeps track of how many times the bug wins and loses.
